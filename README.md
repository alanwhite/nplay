Play zone for node.js, aws lambda, serverless, travis CD, Auth0

Starting Point.
Developing workflows and baseline for the back end of a modern multi-cloud app, designed to be resilient to complete cloud failures, e.g. AWS goes dark, or Azure / GCP. Doesn't try to leverage internal availability mechanisms such as AZs, uses two public cloud infratructure providers and the 3rd party Auth0 service so as not to be dependent on proprietary id and auth mechanisms in each provider.

Let's see where we end up!
